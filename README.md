## Description
Upon opening the screen the user is shown the current date and time. Below they are given a series of boxes for which they can enter text to effectively schedule their work day. The interface color codes the times of day to show what has been done, what should currently be worked on and what needs to be done in future hours. White being in the past, red for the current time and green for future activities.
